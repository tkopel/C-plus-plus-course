//Written Assignment 1 Part B Question 2

//Write a program using a function and a series of if…else statements. 
//The user should be prompted to enter a number in main. 
//The function is called and the number entered is passed to the function. 
//This function parameter will then be used in a series of if…else statements to... 
//...discover and print out the number word within the function (for example, 1=one, 2=two, 3=three, etc.).

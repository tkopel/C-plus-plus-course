//Written Assignment 6 A Question 2

//Create a namespace titled globalType that contains four members. 
//The members should be two named constants, n and rate. 
//It should also contain a variable count and the function printResult. 
//Describe how you would access these 4 members in a program. 
//Do not forget to use the scope resolution operator.

//Comprehensive Programming Assignment Problem 3
//Define a class called Revenue that has 2 private members of demand and price. 
//Include a constructor and a public function that calculates the RevenueValue of the class.
// RevenueValue = demand * price
//Use public functions of the class in a program that computes RevenueValue and 
//displays RevenueValue when demand is 2000 and price is 2.  

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// create class for Revenue
class Revenue {
public:
	Revenue(int startDemand = 1, int startPrice = 1) {
		demand = startDemand;
		price = startPrice;
		
	}
	
	float solveRevenueValue() {
		return(demand*price);
	}
//create private members of demand and price	
private:
	float demand, price;
};


int main() {
	// Declare a revenue object with demand 2000 and price 2
	Revenue rev1(2000, 2);
	
	// Print the revenue value of the object declared above
	cout << "The revenue value when demand is 2000 and price is 2: " << rev1.solveRevenueValue() <<

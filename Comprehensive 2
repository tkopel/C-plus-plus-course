//Comprehensive Programming Assignment Problem 2

//Create a program that takes the temperatures as input and provides as output your sports decision. 
//(Assume that temperatures are only expressed as integers.) 
//In the program include 2 void functions titled getTemp and printActivity, each with an int argument.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// define a variable for temperature
	int temp;
	
	// Function prototypes
	void getTemp(int *);
	void printActivity(int);
	
	// Request user input for temperature using a pointer. 
	getTemp(&temp);
	
	// displays activity based on temp input
	printActivity(temp);
}

void getTemp(int *temp) {
	cout << "Please enter the temperature (in degrees F): ";
	cin >> *temp;
}

void printActivity(int temp) {
	cout << "Today's activity is ";

	// activity based on the temperature
	if(temp > 85)
		cout << "swimming";
	else if(temp > 70)
		cout << "baseball";
	else if(temp > 32)
		cout << "basketball";
	else
		cout << "nothing. Go home!!!";
	cout << "." << endl;
